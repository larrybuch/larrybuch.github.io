      <p><span class="kicker">Course Overview</span>This course will introduce students to various modern tools and techniques used to create interactive map experiences that live on the web.  Students will learn the fundamentals of finding and manipulating data for use in web mapping, designing a user experience around web maps, and using various javascript libraries and cloud services to build custom web-based map projects.</p>
      <p>This is not a “follow the tutorial” lab.  Instructors will present live demonstrations to introduce concepts, but students will execute on their own vision, ideas, and subject matter at every phase.  Each class will consist of 60-90 minutes of instruction/live demos, and the remainder of lab time is for students to begin implementing what they’ve learned to complete that week’s assignment, ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and/or build towards the final project.</p>
